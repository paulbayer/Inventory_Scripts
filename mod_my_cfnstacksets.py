TODO:
	- Pythonize the whole thing
	- More Commenting throughout script
	Make deleting multiple closed accounts easier - needs a parameter that comprises "+delete +force -A -check" all in one - to delete all closed accounts at one time... 

	- There are four possible use-cases:
		- The stack exists as an association within the stackset AND it exists within the child account (typical)
			- We should remove the stackset-association with "--RetainStacks=False" and that will remove the child stack in the child account.
		- The stack exists as an association within the stackset, but has been manually deleted within the child account
			- If we remove the stackset-association with "--RetainStacks=False", it won't error, even when the stack doesn't exist within the child.
			- There is a special use case here where the child account has been deleted or suspended. This is a difficult use-case to test12.
		- The stack doesn't exist within the stackset association, but DOES exist within the child account (because its association was removed from the stackset)
			- The only way to remove this is to remove the stack from the child account. This would have to be done after having found the stack within the child account. This will be a ToDo for later...
		- The stack doesn't exist within the child account, nor within the stack-set
			- Nothing to do here

* if pdryrun and pAccountRemoveList==None
 - This handles the scenario where we're doing a read-only run, and we didn't provide a specific Account that we're interested in.
 - This should be the normal case - where we're just doing a generic read of all stacksets in an account.
 - By default, it will print out the last line - summarizing everything found.
 - If you have additional verbosity set, it will print out a list of stacksets found, and a list of the accounts with the regions enabled by the stacksets,
* if pdryrun (which means you DID specify a specific account you're looking for)
 - It will print that it found that account associated with X number of stacksets.
 - If you have additional verbosity set, it will print out which stacksets that account is associated with, and which regions.
* If this is NOT a dry-run (meaning you want to take action on the stacksets)
 - We assume you're looking to remove accounts from a specific stackset
 - We ask whether you're sure if you want to remove the account, unless you've also supplied the "+force" parameter, which bypasses the extra check
* If you didn't supply the Account Number
 - then we assume you wanted to remove the stack instances from the stackset(s)
 - except we previously allowed certain accounts to be "skipped", so we need to make sure we're skipping those accounts when we remove stack instances from these stacksets.

ExplainMessage = """
Objective: This script aims to identify issues and make it easier to "adopt" an existing account into a Control Tower environment.

0. The targeted account MUST allow the Management account access into the Child IAM role called "AWSControlTowerExecution" or another coded role, so that we have access to do read-only operations (by default).
0a. There must be an "AWSControlTowerExecution" role present in the account so that StackSets can assume it and deploy stack instances. This role must trust the Organizations Management account or at least the necessary Lambda functions.
** TODO ** - update the JSON to be able to update the role to ensure it trusts the least privileged roles from management account, instead of the whole account.
0b. STS must be active in all regions checked. You can check from the Account Settings page in IAM. Since we're using STS to connect to the account from the Management, this requirement is checked by successfully completing step 0.

1. Previously - this was a default VPC check, but this is no longer needed.

2. There must be no active config channel and recorder in the account as “there can be only one” of each. 
	This must also be deleted via CLI, not console, switching config off in the console is NOT good enough and just disables it. To Delete the delivery channel and the configuration recorder (can be done via CLI and Python script only):
aws configservice describe-delivery-channels
aws configservice describe-delivery-channel-status
aws configservice describe-configuration-recorders
aws configservice stop-configuration-recorder --configuration-recorder-name <NAME-FROM-DESCRIBE-OUTPUT>
aws configservice delete-delivery-channel --delivery-channel-name <NAME-FROM-DESCRIBE-OUTPUT>
aws configservice delete-configuration-recorder --configuration-recorder-name <NAME-FROM-DESCRIBE-OUTPUT

3. The account must not have a Cloudtrail Trail name with 'ControlTower' in the name ("aws-controltower-BaselineCloudTrail")

4. The account must not have a pending guard duty invite. You can check from the Guard Duty Console

5. The account must be part of the Organization and the email address being entered into the CT parameters must match the account. 
	If you try to add an email from an account which is not part of the Org, you will get an error that you are not using a unique email address. If it’s part of the Org, CT just finds the account and uses the CFN roles.
** TODO ** - If the existing account will be a child account in the Organization, use the Account Factory and enter the appropriate email address.

6. The existing account can not be in any of the CT-managed Organizations OUs. By default, these OUs are Core and Applications, but the customer may have chosen different or additional OUs to manage by CT.
-- not yet implemented --

7. SNS topics name containing "ControlTower"
8. Lambda Functions name containing "ControlTower"
9. Role name containing "ControlTower"
Bucket created for AWS Config -- not yet implemented
SNS topic created for AWS Config -- not yet implemented
10. CloudWatch Log group containing "aws-controltower/CloudTrailLogs" -- not yet implemented --
